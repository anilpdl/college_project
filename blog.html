<font style="font-size: 35px;" ><u>Why Travelling</u></font><br>
<b>1. You'll Get Out of Your Comfort Zone</b><br>

<p>As young people most of us have a pretty established comfort zone. At home with mom and dad, in a community that has known you for probably a good part of your life. You have your established, friends, activities, hangouts and possibly jobs. We become comfortable in these daily roles and the idea of breaking out them can be scary and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The problem is, you learn the most in uncomfortable, unfamiliar situations. In our daily routines, you know how to act and respond to people and your surroundings. Being in a new place, with different people, who hold different values and go about life differently (or not so differently you may find) strips all that familiarity away.</p>

<p>It can be scary, but once you figure out that you can connect with people despite differences, and you can navigate foreign environments, you become a smarter, more competent individual. Embrace the discomfort. Search for it, because it is helping you grow.</p>

<b>2. Traveling Builds Confidence</b><br>

<p>As you conquer the obstacles of figuring out how to use public transit in a foreign country, or asking for simple things in a grocery store, you are building a confidence and ability to adapt in foreign situations. I remember moving to a country where I spoke little to none of the language.</p>

<p>When I returned home, I moved across the country to a state where I had no family, friends or connections. The prospect of that move may have intimidated me before living abroad, but then I thought to myself.</p>

<b>3. You Will Develop Cultural Sensitivity</b><br>

<p>Being culturally sensitive is key in our globalizing world. It is not enough to say "people from X country are like this."" It is important to look for underlying values that may explain a certain behavior in order to practice cultural sensitivity. A good example is when I was in Spain (especially in the south), where they take a 2-3 hour siesta and lunch in the middle of their work day.</p>

<p>Many people view this cultural norm as the people just being lazy when it really has a lot more to do with the fact that historically Spaniards value family face time. Eating together as a family is more important to them than maximizing work time by scarfing a sandwich down at their desks.</p>

<p>Being aware of cultural values and norms is not only fascinating, but can help us understand international issues and conflicts, or even relate to the cultural norms of a foreign business partner. It is an important skill to be able to shift perspectives and see where someone else is coming from.</p>

<b>4. You Can Adapt to Globalization</b><br>

<p>Whether you like it or not, with the internet and social media, we are globalizing quickly. It is not unlikely that you would end up with a job that has you travel for business or take part in conference calls with international business partners. In our globalizing world it is important to be culturally sensitive and it can't hurt to know a foreign language.</p>

<p>In the business world, having lived abroad can give you a competitive edge. Use the confidence and cultural sensitivity that traveling helps you develop and help it make you successful.</p>

	<font style="font-size: 35px;" ><u>How does travelling benefit us</u></font><br>

	<p>People travel because they want to learn oth- ers cultures. They want to see the difference be- tween their culture and other cultures. They want to learn others culture because for them traveling is fun while learning. One particular thing about the culture is the food.</p>

<p>Not only is travel fun; it provides a variety of surprising personal and health benefits. Studies show travel leads to a greater learning capacity, increased feeling of happiness and satisfaction, better family relationships, and even decreased risk of heart disease.</p>

<p>If you need more convincing, here is a list of all the benefits of traveling.
	<ul>
    <li>Improves Social and Communication Skills.</li>
    <li>Ensures Peace of Mind.</li>
    <li>Helps you Get Original and Creative Thoughts. </li>
    <li>Broadens Your Horizons. </li>
   <li> Enhances your Tolerance for Uncertainty.</li>
    <li>Boosts Up your Confidence. </li>
    <li>Gets you Real-life Education.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Here are five reasons traveling will change your life.
<ul>
    <li>You broaden your perspective.</li>
   <li> You learn to live in the moment.</li>
    <li>You value experience over things.</li>
    <li>You learn to roll with things. </li>
    <li>You are more open to different ways of life.</li>
</ul>
